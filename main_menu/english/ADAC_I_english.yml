 ADAC_Introduction: "After activating OGAS, $game_concept_road$ information will be calculated starting from $game_concept_capital$, and $build_roads$ outward from $game_concept_capital$. \nIf you possess overseas territories or wish to build $game_concept_road$ starting from a prime $game_concept_port$, you may click $OGAS_Add_Road_Departure$ to select a $game_concept_location$ you have planned. OGAS will then directly designate this $game_concept_location$ as $game_concept_road$ departure. Select again to remove the $game_concept_road$ departure.\nOGAS will reserve 1 year $game_concept_balance$, or 500/1250/2500/5000 $game_concept_gold$ depend on $game_concept_road$ $game_concept_advance$ to prevent $game_concept_bankrupt$."
